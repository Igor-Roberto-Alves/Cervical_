# Cervical Cancer Predict with <span style="color: red;">Convolutional Neural Networks</span>.

$$\text{Lucas Barcelos, Igor Roberto}$$

The aim of this repositore is predict cervical cancer throught Convolutional Neural Networks with the [SipakMed Data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prahladmehandiratta/cervical-cancer-largest-dataset-sipakmed?resource=download") avaliable on **Kaggle**

The Data set contain:

- 5 types of cells $\rightarrow$

  - Dyskeratotic **(Canceriginous Cell)**

  - Koilocytotic **(Canceriginous Cell)**

  - Metaplastic (Benign Cell)

  - Parabasal (Normal Cell)

  - Superficial - Intermediate (Normal Cell)



- 966 cell images resulting in 4049 images of isolated cells manually cropped 


The project have been divided in two importants parts

- Fitting Convolution Neural Network for classify cropped cells in each class

- Study methods for automatilly cropped cells images
